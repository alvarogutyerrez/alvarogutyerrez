- I'm passionate about writing and optimizing code in multiple programming languages such as Stata, R, Python and Matlab. This web page is just work in progress, so feel free to take whatever you want from here.

I'm currently working to obtain my Msc(c) in Finance in the University of Chile. Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Economics from the same university.
