- I am so passionate about writing and optimize code in multiple languages such as STATA, R, Python and Matlab. This web page is just a working-progress-one so feel free to take whatever you want from here. 

I graduate from the University of Chile with a Bachelor in Economics and now I am Msc(c) in Finance from same university.
