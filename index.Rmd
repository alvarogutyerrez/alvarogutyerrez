- I'm currently working to obtain my Msc(c) in Finance in the University of Chile. Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Economics from the same university.



 I really like to writte code in multiple programming languages such as Stata, R, Python and Matlab. This web page was 100% programmed using R, and it's _just work-in-progress_, so feel free to take whatever you want from here, everything that you will find here is ready to be downloaded from my [Github](https://github.com/alvarogutyerrez)



Currently, I am working with professor [David Diaz](http://negocios.uchile.cl/academico_detalle.php?id=51) into a Consulting with the HSBC Bank developing predictive models for financial assets using Machine Learning Algorithms with Python.
