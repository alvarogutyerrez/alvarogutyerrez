- I graduate from the University of Chile with a Bachelor in Economics and now I am Msc(c) in Finance from same university. 

I am so passionate about writing and optimize code in multiple languages such as STATA, R, Python and Matlab. This web page is just a working-progress-one so feel free to take whatever you want from here. 

Currently, I am working with professor [David Diaz](http://negocios.uchile.cl/academico_detalle.php?id=51) into a Consulting with the HSBC Bank developing predictive models for financial assets using Machine Learning Algorithms with Python.
