#Welcome!


My name is Alvaro Gutierrez, and despite de fact that I hold an B.A in Econ and a MSc. in Finance, the topic that I feel more confortable with is Statistics and it is where I spend most of the time learning and discovering new and interesting things. In fact, I will be lecturer of Introductory Statistics at the [Faculty of Economics and Business](http://www.fen.uchile.cl/en) of the University of Chile.


I enjoy spending my time writting code or re-writting it more efficiently. Actually, this web page was 100% programmed using R, and it's _just work-in-progress_, so feel free to take whatever you want from here, everything that you will find here is ready to be downloaded from my [Github](https://github.com/alvarogutyerrez).


Currently, I am working with professor [David Diaz](http://negocios.uchile.cl/academico_detalle.php?id=51) developing predictive models for financial assets with Machine Learning Algorithms using Python (mostly [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15/tutorials.html) and [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)).
